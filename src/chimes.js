  /*============================ CHIMES ============================*/

  // REMOVED in v68, deliberately and after real testing: do
  // not bring chimes back without new evidence. Ten chimes
  // (WAV-rendered, played through <audio> elements for
  // screen-off survival) lived here through v67. Games 3
  // and 4 proved iOS silently discards media-element audio
  // while the mic is open: game4 logged SFX ok on all 39
  // accepted moves with zero playback errors, yet four were
  // inaudible, and neither a post-ack delay nor a doubled
  // length helped. Speech was never once lost in four
  // games, so every signal a chime carried is now spoken
  // ("ok.", the rejection sentence, the yes/no question)
  // and the renderer, BEEPS table, element cache, beep()
  // and warmChimes() were deleted. The keep-alive silent
  // WAV was unrelated and outlived them by design - it held
  // the iOS audio session, it was not a chime - until w90
  // removed it too, for its own reasons (see the keep-alive
  // tombstone in header.js).
